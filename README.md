I'm a former software developer at Accenture, now focused on solving business problems with data.  
Over the last year, I’ve independently designed and delivered data projects that generate insights for real-world decision-making — from **investment strategy** to **resume optimization**.

I specialize in:  
- Extracting and cleaning messy real-world data using **SQL**  
- Building decision-oriented dashboards in **Power BI**  
- Telling clear business stories using **DAX** and visuals  
- Rapid prototyping with **LLMs** and no-code AI tools
